My name is Seifu Birega,

I bring over a decade of experience in the IT industry, having grown through roles as a Software Instructor, Database Analyst an Trainer, Software Developer, Software Development Team Lead, Software Project Manager, Senior ICT Manager, ICT Consultant, Agile Project Manager, CTO, and Founder & CEO. This journey shaped me into a results-driven leader who thrives on solving complex technical challenges and aligning technology with strategic goals.

Currently, I lead a talented team of Data Scientists, AI Engineers, Software Developers, UX/UI Designers, QA Testers, and DevOps Engineers, leveraging modern stacks such as Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, LangChain, Supabase, Node.js, React, Next.js, Flutter, Django, Fast API, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, GCP, and Azure. Together, we are building AI-powered EdTech and FinTech products, as well as pioneering Large Language Model (LLM) design for the Amharic language, contributing to digital transformation and advancing AI adoption in Ethiopia and beyond.

I have conducted research on AI, specifically a deep learning model for pedestrian action recognition in Addis Ababa City, which achieved excellent results and earned me a Gold Medal for my postgraduate research and academic excellence. Building on this foundation, I am passionate about advancing research in deep learning and large language models (LLMs) — with a focus on multimodal learning (video + sensor data), transfer learning for diverse urban environments, real-time optimization for traffic management, integrating LLMs for natural language-based action interpretation, and addressing ethical implications through bias mitigation.

I am deeply motivated to drive innovation, build scalable and resilient systems, and foster collaboration that delivers both local and global impact.
