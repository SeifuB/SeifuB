- 👋 Hi, I’m @SeifuB
- Chief Technology Officer / Senior ICT Consultant
With over a decade of experience as a Senior ICT Consultant, Chief Technology Officer and Founder and CEO, I am a results-driven leader specializing in leveraging cutting-edge technology to achieve strategic organizational goals. My expertise spans from Machine Learning and AI to Data Analytics, Big Data, and System Analysis. I thrive on solving complex technical challenges and have a proven track record of leading high-performing teams to design, implement, and optimize robust systems. I am passionate about driving innovation and fostering a collaborative environment to achieve collective success and expand my global perspective.

I have done a research on a deep learning model for pedestrian action recognition, focusing on the case of Addis Ababa City, and achieved an excellent result. However, I am passionate and well-prepared to continue exploring further in this field. Moving forward, I plan to delve into several promising areas for research in deep learning and large language models (LLMs). One focus could be enhancing model accuracy with multimodal data, such as video and sensor inputs, to improve pedestrian behavior prediction. Another direction is adapting pre-trained models to diverse urban environments using transfer learning. I also aim to optimize real-time processing for practical applications like traffic management. Additionally, integrating LLMs with deep learning for natural language-based action interpretation is an exciting prospect. Finally, I am eager to investigate ethical implications and bias mitigation to ensure responsible deployment of these models.
